# 📊 Learning Matplotlib Basics: Line, Bar, Pie Charts, Stack Plots, and Histograms

## 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to my **Matplotlib Basics** repository! This project showcases my journey learning **line charts**, **bar charts**, **pie charts**, **stack plots**, and **histograms** using Matplotlib 📈. The examples are beginner-friendly and focus on fundamental plotting techniques in Python.

## 📂 Contents

-  Learn how to create and customize simple line charts.
-  Discover how to build and style basic bar charts.
-  Explore how to create pie charts with custom labels, colors, and explode segments.
-  Understand how to visualize data trends using stack plots for better cumulative comparisons.
-  Dive into histograms to analyze frequency distributions.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔷 Line Charts
- Plotting with `plt.plot()`
- Customizing line styles (color, width)
- Adding labels, titles, and grids for better clarity

### 🔶 Bar Charts
- Creating vertical bar charts with `plt.bar()` and horizontal bars with `plt.barh()`
- Customizing bar colors, sizes, and adding data labels

### 🟢 Pie Charts
- Building pie charts with `plt.pie()`
- Customizing segments with explode, labels, and colors
- Adding percentage display and understanding pie chart best practices

### 🔵 Stack Plots
- Creating stack plots with `plt.stackplot()`
- Visualizing cumulative data trends
- Adjusting colors, labels, and transparency for clarity

### 🟣 Histograms
- Plotting histograms using `plt.hist()`
- Analyzing frequency distributions
- Customizing bin size, color, and adding density lines

## 🚀 Installation

You’ll need Python 🐍 and Jupyter Notebook 📓 to run the examples. Install Matplotlib and Jupyter using the following:

```bash
pip install matplotlib notebook
```

## 🎉 Summary

This repository reflects my first steps into the world of data visualization with **Matplotlib**. As I grow my skills, I'll be adding more advanced plots and techniques. For now, feel free to explore, learn, and even contribute 🚀!
