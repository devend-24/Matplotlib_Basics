# 📊 Learning Matplotlib Basics: Line and Bar Charts

## 🎯 Introduction

Welcome to my **Matplotlib Basics** repository! This project showcases my journey learning **line charts** and **bar charts** using Matplotlib 📈. The examples are beginner-friendly and focus on fundamental plotting techniques in Python. 

## 📂 Contents

- **[`line_chart.ipynb`](Matplotlib.ipynb)**: Learn how to create and customize simple line charts.
- **[`bar_chart.ipynb`](Bar_charts.ipynb)**: Discover how to build and style basic bar charts.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔷 Line Charts
- Plotting with `plt.plot()`
- Customizing line styles (color, width)
- Adding labels, titles, and grids for better clarity

### 🔶 Bar Charts
- Creating vertical bar charts with `plt.bar()` and horizontal bars with `plt.barh()`
- Customizing bar colors, sizes, and adding data labels

## 🚀 Installation

You’ll need Python 🐍 and Jupyter Notebook 📓 to run the examples. Install Matplotlib and Jupyter using the following:

```bash
pip install matplotlib notebook
```

## 🎉 Summary

This repository is a reflection of my first steps into the world of data visualization with **Matplotlib**. As I grow my skills, I'll be adding more advanced plots and techniques. For now, feel free to explore, learn, and even contribute 🚀!
